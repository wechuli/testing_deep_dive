# Test Driven Development

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is one methodology for writing quality software with a well-thought out testing suite. By following the tenets if TDD, developers will know what to test, in what order, and a way of balancing unit testing and coding application under test.

## What is TDD

Test-Driven Development is a software development methodology that comprises several key points:

1. _Writing tests first, before code_ : Before you even start thinking of how to do something, this forces you to think of what is to be done. Since your code has not been written, you can check that the test initially fails (in order to avoid tautological tests which always pass) and have a specific goal that you are reaching toward (getting the test you just wrote to pass)
2. _Writing code that makes the test pass_ : This ensures you focus on writing relevant code, instead of spending time working on possibly superfluous frameworking or other code. One of the key benefits of TDD is that it allows you to focus, by training you o keep your eye on the one goal of the cycle instead of thinking of all the other possible bits of code that you could be writing.
3. _Writing only tests that test the code_ : It's tempting to write tests for the sake of writing them; this will help to keep tests only being written for the functionality being written.
4. _A short turnaround cycle_ : TDD emphasizes quick cycles, which work to keep the developer on track and focused on a short, specific goal.
5. _Refactoring early and often_ :Refactoring is often held off until later in the development process, when it is much more difficult to do, especially if there has not been much time spent on doing it earlier. That becomes all the more reason not to do it later. By refactoring often, it becomes a part of the development process and a habit, instead of something that will be done "if there's enough time"
