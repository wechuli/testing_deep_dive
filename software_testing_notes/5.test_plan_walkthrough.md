# Test Plan Walkthrough

## Examining the Requirements

In general, however, you should avoid making assumptions: you want to know what the expected behavior is as precisely as possible.

## Plotting Out the Test Plan

Cluster the requirements into tests that are logically related to each other. These clusters will often revolve around specific features (e.g. shopping cart, item display and checkout in an online shopping application) or different sub-systems (e.g user interfaces). There is really no "right answer" as to how to cluster requirements together for testing, and as you understand the system better, the clustering may change. However, by providing a general outline, you can start to get a handle on testing the system holistically.
