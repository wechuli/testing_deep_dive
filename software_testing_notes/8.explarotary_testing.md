# Exploratory Testing

This is defined as testing without a specified test plan, where the main goal is to learn about and influence the development of the system, as opposed to specifically determining whether the observed behavior is equal to the expected behavior. Exploratory testing allows the tester to follow their own path, thinking of edge cases on the fly or following leads if something seems like it may cause a problem. It also allows the tester to learn by doing, instead of reading design documentation or code, which is often much more effective way to understand a system.
