# What is Software Testing

## What Software Testing is NOT

- It's not finding every single defect
- It's not randomly pressing buttons, hoping that something will break
- It's not hoping something will break
- It's not something you do after all the programming is complete
- It's really not something you postpone until users start complaining

## Definition of Software Testing

At a high level, software testing is a way of providing an estimate of software quality to stakeholders.

Software testing provides an independent view of the software product.

## Verification and Validation

Software testing also involves ensuring that the right software was created. Verification is ensuring that you're building the software right; validation is ensuring that you're building the right software. In other words, verification is ensuring that the system doesn't crash, that it meets the requirements, that it handles failures gracefully etc. Validation is ensuring that the requirements meet the actual needs of the customer.

A system with a good automated test suite will allow you to make changes with the assurance that you have not created additional defects in so doing.

A defect is an issue that either breaks the functionality of the system as it's currently understood or does not meet the requirements of the program.

Being familiar with the system under test and its domain can allow you to perform "seal of your pants" testing; that is, testing for behavior that is not formally specified, but based on your knowledge of the system and domain, is to be expected.

Software testing allows you to determine the impact of found defects, as well as the potential risks of fixing defects, making enhancements, or simply providing workarounds.

Remember that the reason behind testing software is to estimate - and if possible , reduce- the risk to stakeholders. Understanding the possible risks can itself help to reduce risk. Testing helps figure out whether there are issues with the software which are trivial, or problems which should stop the product from shipping because major functionality does not work. By helping determine the level of risk, software testers allow the other stakeholders involved to make appropriate decisions.

# Why Test Software

## 1. No Software Developer is Perfect

## 2. Catching Defects Sooner Rather than Later

The Golden Rule of Testing is that you should find defects as early as you can. If you find problems with the software early on, it is often trivial for a developer to add a fix, nobody external to the team may ever know. Software testing allows you to find these errors before users see them, when your team will do a better job of fixing them, with less impact to the bottom line.

## 3. Stability

Developing software is a complex process. At some times, on some teams, it can even devolve into chaos. A testing team can help alleviate this by providing stability. By ensuring that developers continue to work on software that contains fewer defects, the software can stay on a more stable footing. Additional functionality is less likely to be built on top of a shaky foundation.

## 4. Customer Advocacy

QA engineers have a special role to play - they act as a representative of the customers and users of the software. Their role is to ensure that the customer gets high-quality software that is what the customer wants.In fact, in some organizations, software testers have the power to halt a release or allocate resources in order to ensure that the customer receives the right software, built right.

## 5. An Independent, Whole-System Perspective

Developers are focused on a very small parts of a system, with which they become intimately familiar. Rare is the developer who has an understanding of the entire system under development. Testers may not have depth of knowledge of any piece of the software, but do tend to have a broad perspective of the system as a whole. They are testing various aspects of the system, trying out new functionality and installing it on different kinds of systems.

This whole-system perspective provides a valuable counterpoint to those who are heads-down on one area of the software. Understanding how different subsystems work together, and how functionality works from a user perspective, lets QA personnel provide information on the status of the system as a system. This also makes testers a valuable resource when new functionality is added or modified, as they will understand how this might impact the overall system.

## 6. Ensuring Quality

While quality does not only mean “reducing the number of defects”, it is certainly an important part. By finding defects, software testers directly improve the quality of software.

## 7. Risk

The reason for testing software boils down to minimizing risk, for everybody involved: customers, users, developers etc. Independent testing of the software allow for objective analysis of the quality of the system. This reduces risk by providing information on the status of the system, both at a high level and a low level. Software development is a complex and risky process. If you want to reduce risk, software testers are essential as part of the team.
