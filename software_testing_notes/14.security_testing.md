# Security Testing

## Challenges in Security Testing

Security testing differs from other kinds of software testing in that there is an intelligent adversary. Security testing requires you to think like your adversary.

The most dangerous defects tend to be the ones that use the system in ways that normal people generally don't even conceive. Security failures can be catastrophic and tend to have worse impacts than similar functional failures. Assuming a good backup strategy and other simple safety procedures, most functional or nonfunctional defects will not cause much havoc.
