# Requirements

Validating software is ensuring that we are building the right software; in other words, ensuring that what we are creating is what the users want. In order to validate software, we need to know what it is that users want the software to do, which can be a much more difficult task.Users often aren’t able to specify exactly what they are looking for. They may think that they know exactly what they want, but when they see the implementation, immediately know that it is not. Or they may have no idea—they just want your team to build something

One way of determining what software to build is to determine the requirements of the software. Requirements are statements specifying exactly what it is that a piece of software should be under a certain conditions.

Requirements ensure that the developers know what to build and the testers know what to test.

When writing requirements, it's important to keep in mind that requirements state what the system should do, not how it should do it. In other words, it should not specify the implementation details, but only how the system or subsystem interacts and interfaces with the world around it.

## Testability

From a tester's perspective, one of the most important aspects of requirements is whether or not they are testable. From a software development life cycle perspective, "testable requirements" is another term for "good requirements". A requirement that cannot be tested cannot be shown to have been met.

In order for the requirements to be testable, they must meet five criteria:

1. **Complete** - Requirements should cover the entire operation of the system. Anything that is not covered by the requirements is liable to be interpreted in different ways by developers, designers, testers and users. If something is important, it should be specified precisely.
2. **Consistent**
3. **Unambiguous**
4. **Quantitative**
5. **Feasible to test**
