# What is Software Testing

## What Software Testing is NOT

- It's not finding every single defect
- It's not randomly pressing buttons, hoping that something will break
- It's not hoping something will break
- It's not something you do after all the programming is complete
- It's really not something you postpone until users start complaining

## Definition of Software Testing

At a high level, software testing is a way of providing an estimate of software quality to stakeholders.

Software testing provides an independent view of the software product.

## Verification and Validation

Software testing also involves ensuring that the right software was created. Verification is ensuring that you're building the software right; validation is ensuring that you're building the right software. In other words, verification is ensuring that the system doesn't crash, that it meets the requirements, that it handles failures gracefully etc. Validation is ensuring that the requirements meet the actual needs of the customer.

A system with a good automated test suite will allow you to make changes with the assurance that you have not created additional defects in so doing.

A defect is an issue that either breaks the functionality of the system as it's currently understood or does not meet the requirements of the program.

Being familiar with the system under test and its domain can allow you to perform "seal of your pants" testing; that is, testing for behavior that is not formally specified, but based on your knowledge of the system and domain, is to be expected.

Software testing allows you to determine the impact of found defects, as well as the potential risks of fixing defects, making enhancements, or simply providing workarounds.

Remember that the reason behind testing software is to estimate - and if possible , reduce- the risk to stakeholders. Understanding the possible risks can itself help to reduce risk. Testing helps figure out whether there are issues with the software which are trivial, or problems which should stop the product from shipping because major functionality does not work. By helping determine the level of risk, software testers allow the other stakeholders involved to make appropriate decisions.
